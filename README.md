# ArtsAPI ETL

The ETL tooling for ArtsAPI, based on the [Grafter project](http://grafter.org). Mainly focussed on email parsing and RDF conversion. 

## Ontology

In the `doc` folder, there is a version controlled turtle representation of the ArtsAPI ontology, as well as a number of example resources.

## UK SIC 2007 Ontology

In the `doc` folder, there is an ontology and RDF resources that correspond to the UK SIC 2007 framework. The data was created using the `sic2007` template in the project, from the source Excel file in `doc`, sourced from the [official ONS page](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/standard-industrial-classification/index.html). 

## Usage

Use `lein run <path-to-mbox-file> <destination.ttl>` to convert Email or Twitter data. The tool expects you to pass it an absolute path to an mbox file, or the JavaScript `tweet` folder of a Twitter dump. From the root of a Twitter dump, this directory may be found at `./data/js/tweets`.

To import into a db, use `lein run <path-to-mbox-file> <query-endpoint> <update-endpoint>` and your emails will be converted and loaded into the db in batches.

*Please Note* very large mbox files have to be loaded into memory first. This is why the JVM memory allocation is set very high (7GB) - reduce this in `project.clj` if necessary. This converter has been tested with this configuration with files up to 2.85GB and will still run correctly. Any larger and you will have to break your mbox file up into smaller collections before you can convert it.
