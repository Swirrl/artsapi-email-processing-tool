# ArtsAPI ETL

The ETL tooling for ArtsAPI, based on the [Grafter project](http://grafter.org). Mainly focussed on email parsing and RDF conversion. 

## Ontology

In the `doc` folder, there is a version controlled turtle representation of the ArtsAPI ontology, as well as a number of example resources.

## UK SIC 2007 Ontology

In the `doc` folder, there is an ontology and RDF resources that correspond to the UK SIC 2007 framework. The data was created using the `sic2007` template in the project, from the source Excel file in `doc`, sourced from the [official ons page](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/standard-industrial-classification/index.html).
